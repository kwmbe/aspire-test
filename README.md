# Aspire test

Small repository made to learn more about [Aspire](https://aspire.dev/), and to test out
dotnet development on linux.
All development is done in [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), so the project
might look or function differently in other IDEs.

## Running the project
1. Make sure Docker is installed and the daemon is running, since aspire uses docker to host
different parts of the application.
2. That's all. Press `F5` to run the project, this should open a webpage.
